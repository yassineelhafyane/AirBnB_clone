# File Storage

This is a Python module for storing and retrieving data for an Airbnb clone application. It defines a class called `FileStorage` that has several methods for interacting with data stored in a `JSON` file.

The first line `#!/usr/bin/python3` is known as a "shebang" and is used to specify the path of the interpreter that should be used to execute the script. 
In this case, it specifies that the script should be executed using `Python 3`.

The import statements are used to import necessary modules such as `datetime`, `json`, and `os`.

The `FileStorage` class has several methods:

* `all()`:
	* returns a dictionary of all objects that have been stored.
* `new(obj)`:
	* sets the dictionary of objects with a class name key.
* `save()`:
	* saves the dictionary of objects to a JSON file.
* `classes()`:
	* returns a dictionary of valid class instances for the application.
* `reload()`
	* reloads the data that has been previously stored in the JSON file.
* `attributes()`:
	* returns a dictionary of the attributes for each class instance.

The `__file_path` and `__objects` variables are private variables that are used within the class methods. 
	* `__file_path` specifies the path to the JSON file that is used for storing the data,
	* `__objects` is a dictionary that stores the data.

Overall, this module provides a way to store and retrieve data for an Airbnb clone application, using a JSON file as the data store.
